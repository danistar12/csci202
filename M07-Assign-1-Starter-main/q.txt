The current implementation of the HashTable class supports both quadratic probing 
and chaining for collision resolution. It is well-structured, with proper 
initialization of the table, occupied, and chainTable attributes based on the 
selected resolution strategy. 

However, the quadratic probing implementation could potentially benefit from 
additional checks to ensure that the size parameter is valid and that the hash 
table is not overfilled. The chaining implementation is straightforward and avoids 
probing altogether, making it more robust for densely populated tables. 

Both methods are functional, but the choice of resolution strategy should depend 
on the expected table load and hash distribution.
